--- Game ---
Each game is a set of scenes. The game's responsibility is deciding which scene comes next and 
triggering it.  

--- Scenes ---
Each scene is a page, waiting for user interaction. Each scene type has its own logic, controlling when 
and how the user can proceed to the next one.

E.g. 
- The scene is just some text where the user can proceed if they click the next button
- The scene is a camera view, where the user can proceed if the take a certain kind of a photo

Each scene type has its own module:
- model.ts: the logic behind the given scene type - e.g. test if the taken picture contains the solution  
- main.xml: the visualization of the given scene type - e.g. a camera view
- main.ts:  the logic behind the visualization - e.g. the initialization of the camera view
